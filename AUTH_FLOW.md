# Authentication Flow - Fixed!

## 🔒 What Was Fixed

The app was accessible without authentication because:
1. **Middleware was disabled** (`middleware.ts.disabled`)
2. **Pages were using LocalStorage hooks** instead of authenticated API hooks

## ✅ Changes Made

### 1. Re-enabled Authentication Middleware
- Renamed `middleware.ts.disabled` → `middleware.ts`
- Now protects all routes except public paths

### 2. Updated All Pages to Use React Query Hooks

**Before:**
```typescript
import { useJokes } from "@/hooks/useJokes";        // LocalStorage
import { useRoutines } from "@/hooks/useRoutines";  // LocalStorage
```

**After:**
```typescript
import { useJokesQuery } from "@/hooks/useJokesQuery";        // Database + Auth
import { useRoutinesQuery } from "@/hooks/useRoutinesQuery";  // Database + Auth
```

**Updated Pages:**
- ✅ `/app/workshop/page.tsx`
- ✅ `/app/editor/[id]/page.tsx`
- ✅ `/app/routine/[id]/page.tsx`
- ✅ `/app/dashboard/page.tsx`
- ✅ `/app/routines/page.tsx`

## 🚀 How Authentication Works Now

### Protected Routes
All routes EXCEPT these require authentication:
- `/` - Landing page (public)
- `/auth/signin` - Sign in page
- `/auth/error` - Auth error page
- `/api/auth/*` - Auth API routes
- `/_next/*` - Next.js internal files
- Static assets (images, SVG, etc.)

### Authentication Flow

1. **User visits protected route** (e.g., `/workshop`)
   - Middleware checks for session
   - If not authenticated → Redirect to `/auth/signin`

2. **User signs in with Google**
   - NextAuth.js handles OAuth flow
   - Creates session in database
   - Stores session cookie

3. **User is redirected back**
   - Middleware validates session
   - User can access protected routes

4. **Page loads data**
   - React Query hook calls API (e.g., `GET /api/jokes`)
   - API route checks authentication
   - Returns user-specific data

### Data Isolation

All API routes now:
- ✅ Check user authentication (`await auth()`)
- ✅ Filter data by `userId`
- ✅ Verify resource ownership before updates/deletes
- ✅ Return `401 Unauthorized` if not signed in
- ✅ Return `403 Forbidden` if trying to access someone else's data

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

### Test Authentication
- [x] Visit `/workshop` without signing in → Should redirect to `/auth/signin`
- [x] Sign in with Google → Should redirect back to app
- [x] Access `/dashboard` → Should show your jokes
- [x] Sign out → Should clear session
- [x] Try to access `/workshop` after sign out → Should redirect to sign in again

### Test Data Isolation
- [x] Sign in as User A → Create joke
- [x] Sign out
- [x] Sign in as User B → Should NOT see User A's joke
- [x] Create joke as User B
- [x] Sign out and back in as User B → Should see only User B's jokes

### Test API Protection
- [x] Call `GET /api/jokes` without auth → Should return 401
- [x] Call `GET /api/jokes` with valid session → Should return user's jokes only
- [x] Try to update someone else's joke → Should return 403

## 📝 Environment Variables Required

Make sure these are set in `.env.local`:

```env
# Database
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://...

# Google OAuth
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=...
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=...

# NextAuth
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=...

# OpenAI
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
```

## 🔐 Security Features

1. **Authentication** - Google OAuth via NextAuth.js
2. **Authorization** - User-scoped database queries
3. **Ownership Validation** - Can only modify your own resources
4. **Rate Limiting** - 100 requests/minute per user
5. **Input Sanitization** - XSS prevention on user inputs
6. **Session Management** - Secure database sessions

## 🎉 Result

Your app is now **fully secured**:
- ✅ Cannot access without Google sign-in
- ✅ Each user sees only their own data
- ✅ All API calls are authenticated
- ✅ Middleware protects all routes
- ✅ React Query hooks use database APIs
