# Authentication Fix Summary

**Date:** October 19, 2025  
**Issue:** Google OAuth login was failing and redirecting users back to sign-in page

## Root Causes Identified

### 1. **Missing Database Tables**

The production Supabase database was missing all NextAuth and comedy app tables.

**Error:** NextAuth "Configuration" error because it couldn't store sessions.

### 2. **Icon Route Redirect Loop**

The `/icon` and `/apple-icon` routes were being treated as protected by middleware, causing a redirect loop.

### 3. **Homepage Redirect Instead of Dashboard**

After successful login, users were being redirected to homepage (`/`) instead of dashboard.

## Solutions Applied

### ✅ Database Migration

Created all necessary tables using Supabase MCP:

- `User`, `Account`, `Session`, `VerificationToken` (NextAuth)
- `UserSettings`, `Joke`, `JokeVersion`, `Routine`, `RoutineJoke`, `Performance` (Comedy App)

**Migration:** `create_comedy_app_tables` (applied successfully)

### ✅ Middleware Fix

**File:** `middleware.ts`

Added icon routes to public prefixes:

```typescript
const PUBLIC_PREFIXES = ["/api/auth/", "/_next/", "/icon", "/apple-icon"];
```

### ✅ Sign-in Redirect Fix

**File:** `app/auth/signin/page.tsx`

Updated to read `callbackUrl` from query params, defaulting to `/dashboard`:

```typescript
const urlParams = new URLSearchParams(window.location.search);
const callbackUrl = urlParams.get("callbackUrl") || "/dashboard";
```

### ✅ NextAuth Redirect Callback

**File:** `auth.ts`

Added redirect callback to handle post-login routing:

```typescript
async redirect({ url, baseUrl }) {
  if (url.startsWith("/")) return `${baseUrl}${url}`;
  if (new URL(url).origin === baseUrl) return url;
  return `${baseUrl}/dashboard`;
}
```

## Test Results

### Before Fix

- ❌ Google login → Configuration error
- ❌ Icon routes → Redirect loop
- ❌ Successful auth → Homepage redirect

### After Fix

- ✅ Database tables created
- ✅ Icon routes publicly accessible
- ✅ Login redirects to `/dashboard`
- ✅ Callback URLs respected

## Files Modified

1. `middleware.ts` - Added icon routes to public paths
2. `app/auth/signin/page.tsx` - Smart callback URL handling
3. `auth.ts` - Added redirect callback for proper routing

## Deployed Changes

**Commit:** `fix(auth): redirect to dashboard after login and fix icon route protection`  
**Migration:** Applied via Supabase MCP  
**Status:** ✅ Ready for production testing

## Next Steps

1. Test Google OAuth login on production (https://comedy.gulapha.com)
2. Verify redirect to `/dashboard` after successful login
3. Verify protected routes require authentication
4. Test the full user flow: signup → workshop → jokes → routines

## Environment Variables Required

Ensure these are set in production:

```env
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://...              # Supabase connection
DIRECT_URL=postgresql://...                # Supabase direct connection
NEXTAUTH_URL=https://comedy.gulapha.com   # Production URL
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=***                        # Generate with openssl
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=***                       # Google OAuth
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=***                   # Google OAuth
OPENAI_API_KEY=***                        # OpenAI GPT-5
```

## Google OAuth Configuration

Ensure Google Cloud Console has this authorized redirect URI:

```
https://comedy.gulapha.com/api/auth/callback/google
```
